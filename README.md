# RumorDetection-with-Multi-ML-Models
We created an ensemble solution using multi-ML models to improve the performance of rumor detection, particularly the ones that are new and emerging rumors (i.e., unknown rumor).

## Rumor dataset
To build and test Multi-ML-Models, we used PHEME dataset (retrieved from: https://figshare.com/articles/PHEME_dataset_for_Rumour_Detection_and_Veracity_Classification/6392078).

## Ensemble solution code
The implementation of the ensemble solution will be released once the paper has been published. 

## Result dataset
The overview of results can be found here: [link](/result__performance_analysis)
Full result dataset will be released once the paper has been published.
